        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 1997 in the heart of Japan's Koi industry, Koifish International was born out of a 
          desire to raise the standards of Koi supply. Unsatisfied with the quality and logistics of 
          available Koi, we established our own operations to improve the overall process. Today, we 
          continue to set the industry standard for quality, quarantine procedures, and export logistics.
        </p>

      <section className="about-us-section">
        <h2>Commitment to Quality</h2>
        <p>
          We take pride in our permanent base in Ojiya, Japan, the epicenter of the Japanese Koi 
          industry. Our dedicated team works directly with Koi breeders to ensure that we provide the 
          healthiest, most vibrant Koi available. Our rigorous health protocols and expert logistics 
          are now widely adopted by others in the industry, but as pioneers, we remain at the forefront 
          of Koi export management.
